        "Statistically, a larger portion of the US population is introverted.
        The original randomized Myers-Briggs type indicator sample showed that
        50.7% of Americans are introverts and extroverts make up 49.3% of the
        population." Being an introvert isn't a bad thing, there are just some
        minor setbacks that come with being an introvert. Not being able to
        expand your social network because you're uncomfortable with small talk
        and meeting new people is a challenge that the majority of American's face. Our app, Introvert
        Empowerment, is able to help you overcome social disadvantages and help
        boost confidence.{" "}
