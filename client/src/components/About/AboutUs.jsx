        "Statistically, a slightly larger portion of the US population is
        introverted. The original randomized Myers-Briggs type indicator sample
        showed that 50.7% of Americans are introverts." Being an introvert isn't
        a bad thing. However, there are some challenges such as difficulty
        expanding one's social network and meeting new people face to face that
        can hold an introvert back. Our app, Introvert Empowerment, is able to
        help you overcome social disadvantages and can boost confidence.
