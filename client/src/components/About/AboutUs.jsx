        "Statistically, a slightly larger portion of the US population is
        introverted. The original randomized Myers-Briggs type indicator sample
        showed that 50.7% of Americans are introverts." Being an introvert isn't
        a bad thing, but there are some challenges to overcome such as:
        discomfort with small talk preventing you from being able to expand your
        social network and meeting new people face to face. Our app, Introvert
        Empowerment, is able to help you overcome social disadvantages and can
        boost confidence.{" "}
