            "Statistically, a larger portion of the US population is introverted. The original randomized Myers-Briggs type indicator sample showed that 50.7% of Americans are introverts and extroverts make up 49.3% of the population."
             regardless if this is true or not, there are still many introverts. There isnt a problem being an introvert, there are just some minor setbacks that come with being an introvert. For example, not being able to expand your social
