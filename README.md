Active Development: 10/6/2022 - 10/27/2022
</p>
<p>
Introvert Empowerment was built for those of us in the world who know ourself as an introvert but would like to be more outgoing from time to time. Users can access many features including: challenges, a task manager, pickup lines, and more that can help embolden and give confidence. Another encouraging feature of Intrivert Empowerment is the 'Message of the Day' that is on the landing page. This message is pulled from an API that provides uplifting quotes to start the users' day off right.

We'd love for you to feel empowered too at <a href="live link coming soon">Introvert Empowerment</a>!

## Code Examples
Express used to create databases to store all the challenge information
``` javascript 
 'use strict';

const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const { Model } = require('sequelize');

module.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) => {
  class User extends Model {
    static associate(models) {
      User.belongsToMany(models.Challenge, {
        as: 'challenges',
        through: models.UserChallenge,
        forignKey: 'userId',
        otherKey: 'challengeId',
      });

      User.belongsToMany(models.Conversation, {
        as: 'conversations',
        through: models.UserConversation,
        forignKey: 'userId',
        otherKey: 'conversationId',
      });

      User.belongsToMany(models.PickupLine, {
        as: 'pickuplines',
        through: models.UserPickupLine,
        forignKey: 'userId',
        otherKey: 'pickupLineId',
      });
    }
  }
  User.init({
    email: DataTypes.STRING,
    password: DataTypes.STRING
  },
    {
      hooks: {
        async beforeCreate(user) {
          user.password = await bcrypt.hash(user.password, 10);
        },
      },
      sequelize,
      modelName: 'User',
    }
  );
  return User;
};
```

## Process
<p>
Interiorize was designed to function similarly to the popular clothing subscription service, Stitch Fix. But without professional designers on our payroll, we needed to find a way to mock that personalized functionality with just software. To do that we created a mock database of 100 products gathered from Wayfair. These products were organized into a spreadsheet based on style (modern, farmhouse, contemporary, and bohemian) and room. Price, images, description, color, and brand were also collect from these items. This database is the core of Interiorize and allowed us to successfully mock the basic functionality of a personalized subscription service.
</p>
<p>View the spreadsheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ru5krQQjEa66y6xwguIUm4_JMwNrWN1gAIL9b8eHNOk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>Frontend design mockup can be viewed <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAEmu5jJqUg/tvbk3hckIqgr0xSnjSxYqQ/view?utm_content=DAEmu5jJqUg&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton">here</a>.<p>

## Challenges
<p>
A big challenge for our group was working with a database of only 100 items. A bigger database of items would've allowed for us to create style boxes easier and more aligned with customer's style choices. At the moment, color preferences are stored, but not currently being used to filter items. A bigger database would've allowed us to filter items by color.  </p>
<p>
Working with our own API was both a challenge and an advantage. We could easily alter routes if we weren't getting the information we needed on the frontend, but some of the PostgreSQL queries eventually became long and complicated.</p>

## Goals
<ul>
<li><strong>Admin Dashboard -</strong> If Interiorize needed to be production ready for a business, it would need an admin dashboard. From the admin dashboard, employees would be able to see user's quiz results, recent transactions, and more. 
</li>
<li><strong>Reviews -</strong> Adding functionality for users to be able to review previous orders. Rather than displaying these reviews to the public, this information would go back to the "stylists" to better inform their decisions for the next box.</li>
<li><strong>Payment -</strong> During our two weeks of active development, we were not able to implement any sort of mock payment setup. Adding a payment page would have been the final touch to the ecommerce portion of the project.</li>
</ul>
